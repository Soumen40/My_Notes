Feature generation from POSCAR by myself and put them into the database
1. Surface Area
2. Surface energy ( might need to calculate for each pristine nanoparticles already optimized using the formula in "Stability and Electronic Structures of Pt-Rh Icosahedral Nanoparticles")
3. Diameter (size)
    Note: How to get radius (r)
        1. find out central atom and get largest distance from it which will be r
        2. As the structure get distorted, you know the central position thn do point no 1 (suitable if structure is symmetrycally distorted around center ----- check this)

4. Coordination number of each surface atoms (Code avialable here: "Size‑, Shape‑, and Composition-Dependent Model for Metal Nanoparticle Stability Prediction")
5. We can use normal distance cutoff to get generalize coordination number (put cut off 3 angs all atoms inside that distance are the CN)

6. Use graph based method to generate structural feature after getting CN for all atoms ( or you can take surface atoms only ) using Sucheta di's code



10. Elemental features from matminer (Please look into DScribe and RDKIt) (difference in atomic radius, electronegativity etc)
11. Use state = ("range") to get difference in values of elemental properties (from ElementalProperty class)
                = ("mean") for composition weigthed elemental properties
