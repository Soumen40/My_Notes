For the COR (Chlorine oxdidation reaction) we go ahead with 2e- process, then disproportionation to ClO- in basic media (site - chapter)
As there is no metal oxide, only bare system
For oxiginated surface, the mechanism will be different

For Sea-water to H2 production ( as there are various corrosive element, ions present we allow them to present as it is)
    water split to H+ and OH- then in cathod H+ will bw converted to H2 (green energy carrirer) and in anode instead 
    of doing sluggis OER people tried with simplier 2e- CER ( but the product is corrosive), alternatively the N2H2
    oxidation which occurs at very low electrod potential and with no pollutant emmision is the greener one.
