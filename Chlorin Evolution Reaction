For the COR (Chlorine oxdidation reaction) we go ahead with 2e- process, then disproportionation to ClO- in basic media (site - chapter)
As there is no metal oxide, only bare system
For oxiginated surface, the mechanism will be different

For Sea-water to H2 production ( as there are various corrosive element, ions present we allow them to present as it is)
    water split to H+ and OH- then in cathod H+ will bw converted to H2 (green energy carrirer) and in anode instead 
    of doing sluggis OER people tried with simplier 2e- CER ( but the product is corrosive), alternatively the N2H2
    oxidation which occurs at very low electrod potential and with no pollutant emmision is the greener one.



    Cl on compo is more strongly adsorbe than the nano ------ prolem of leaving of Cl (Check this) 

    We have to also so that COR is good than OER over the metal air battery 
    As in experiment they reduced the pH and got more COR activity than OER than in pH = 14

    However we are not considering any solvent effect ( but we should as the OER intermediates will effect more by solvent than COR then there will be no longer linear cancelation of imtermediates stability due to solvent and pH)
