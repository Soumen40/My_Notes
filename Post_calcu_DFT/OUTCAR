Most of the things which we need to know are present in OUTCAR
Starting from reciprocal lattice vectors (scaled by 2pi, to find in OUTCAR search by /2pi) (if you want to calculate reciprocal space volume you can use those vector and need to multiply by 2pi)
Force on each atoms are given at the final Total force section while optimizing 
Stress are given in vasprun.xml (search by ?stress) (? sign is for the final value of what you are looking for)
