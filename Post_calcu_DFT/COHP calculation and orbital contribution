Calculation Procedure

1. Do an scf calculation using suitable INCAR for COHP
2. Copy labstar and wsDragon executer to the folder of scf calculation
3. run the command ----- ./lobstar lobstarin 
    lobstarin is the input file which specifies which orbital to take and between which atom we want the ICOHP
4. The above command will create several files, more improtant are the two ---- ICOHPLIST.lobster and COHPCAR.lobster

5. ICOHPLIST.lobster file provides the information about the ICOHP value

6. To plot the pCOHP ---- mannually open wsDragon (double click) and open the file COHPCAR.lobster, now you can plot


Find out which file contains the orbital contribution data (start with G)
