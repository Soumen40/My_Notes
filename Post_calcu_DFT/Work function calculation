First generate LOCPOT file by running a SCF with the following INCAR file

        SYSTEM = Graphene
        ISTART = 0
        #ISIF = 3
        ISMEAR =  0
        SIGMA = 0.01
        EDIFF =  1E-5
        ENCUT = 450
        EDIFFG = -0.01
        IBRION = 2
        #POTIM = 0.5
        NSW  = 0
        ISPIN = 2
        NCORE = 48

        #DFT-D3

        #IVDW = 11

        # Not Write

        LWAVE = .FALSE.
        #LCHARG =- .FALSE.
        # LOCPOT calculation

        #LVHAR = .TRUE.
        LVTOT = .TRUE.

        ALGO = FAST
        Either LVHAR or LVTOT must be set true


1. Plot the Z-component of the LOCPOT from P4Vasp
    Calculate the vacuum energy from the plot, take the energy value for maximum z (which is along x-axis here)

2. Find out the Fermi energy from OUTCAR---- grep fermi OUTCAR (take E-fermi value)

3. Take the difference (Evacuum - Efermi). This is the work function for the material
