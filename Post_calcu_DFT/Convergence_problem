KPOINTS and ENCUT convergence problem can be solved

It is not neccesarily the fact that the total energy will always decrease with the increament of KPOINTS or ENCUT


However you need to find out where there is not difference in total energy while mauntaining a certail treshold (10^-4 eV)
There is reference: Find in Teams
