Say I want to Calculate charge density difference of O2 adsorption on a heterogeneous catalyst surface
steps:
    1. I have optimize structure of the total O2 adsorbed catalyst system
    2. Find out (NGX, NGY, NGZ, NGXF, NGYF, NGZF) valuse from the OUTCAR file of above
    3. Create two structures from the optimize one, one will have only O2 (delete other atom from the CONTCAR) 
       and 2nd will have only catalyst (delete O2)
    4. Do single point calculation for both the structures with  (NGX, NGY, NGZ, NGXF, NGYF, NGZF) values in INCAR
    5. Using chgsum.pl add CHGCAR of newly generated structures (by naming them CHGCAR1 and CHGCAR2) ---> CHGCAR_sum
    6. Use chgdif.pl to take the difference between CHGCAR of actual adsorbed structure and CHGCAR_sum
    7. Plot CHGCAR_dif (generated in last point) in VESTA change the isosurface values a bit to get nicer plot
