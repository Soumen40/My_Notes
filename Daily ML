Other way of doing with pandas dataframe

Here I can learn A whole process of Machine Learning (data generation, feature generation, making X and y, ML model, validation of model, improvement of model

home_data = pd.read_csv(iowa_file_path)
y = home_data.SalePrice
#y = home_data["SalePrice"].values # here the error is data in ND arraey

# Feature selection from your dataframe (drop methods works for small no of columns)
feature_names = ["LotArea", "YearBuilt", "1stFlrSF", "2ndFlrSF", "FullBath"]

X=home_data[feature_names]

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
#specify the model. 
#For model reproducibility, set a numeric value for random_state when specifying the model
iowa_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)

# Fit the model
iowa_model.fit(X,y)

predictions = iowa_model.predict(X)
print(predictions)

# Check how much accuaratelt the model is predicting by comparing first few y value with predictions you defined

home_data.head()
