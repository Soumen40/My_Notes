"""
This is the more details way for vasp, vtst as well as vaspsol integration

"""

This for for 
	1. Installation of vasp.6.3.2 and integration with vaspsol.
	2. Integration of vtst with vasp.6.3.2 and final integration with vasp_vtst.6.3.2 with vaspsol

A. For vasp installation:

	1. Download the version if you have license 
	2. Go to the vasp 6.x.x directory : cp arch/makefile.include.intel makefile.include
		modify the MLK root (where is your compiler: Take a look into the already compiled vasp6.x.x/makefile.include)
	3. module load intel_ps_xe_2020.4.304 (load the intel compiler available)
	4. make veryclean
	5. make std (if build then run make all)
	6. Run a test calculation 

B. Vaspsol intergation in vasp6.x.x:
	
	1. Copy the original compiled vasp6.x.x to vasp.6.x.x_sol
	2. Go to the vasp.6.x.x_sol directory: copy the solvation.F to the vasp.6.x.x_sol/src and the patch file in the vasp.6.x.x_sol directory 
		solvation.F and the patch files are from developer
	3. Inside vasp.6.x.x_sol directory: run: patch -p1 < vasp.6.x.x_patch
	4. Modify the makefile.include: Add extra "CPP_OPTIONS += -Dsol_compat" in the CPP_OPTIONS section as last line (see the modified .include file)
	5. Do 3, 4, and 5th steps of A
	6. Run a test calculation

C. For vtst integration:
	
	Copy the compiled vasp6.x.x for safely and then do this
	
	1. Download the vtstcode from https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/download.html
	2. Follow the instruction to first copy .F files from vtst6.x.x to your src, then modify main.F and .objects file inside src (https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/installation.html)
	3. One thing: use the chain.F of the vtst6.x.x (As one sentence is confusing about which chain.F need to use in the above link)
	4. Change the makefile.include (add this CPP_OPTIONS += -Duse_vtst in the CPP_OPTIONS section as last line)
	5. Finally install (3, 4, and 5th steps of A)
	6. Run a test calculation

D. For vaspsol integration with vasp6.x.x_vtst:

	Copy the vasp6.x.x_vtst to vaspsol6.x.x_vtst
	1. Go to the vaspsol6.x.x_vtst directory copy the solvation.F to the vasp.6.x.x_sol/src and the patch file to the vasp.6.x.x_sol directory
		solvation.F and the patch files are from developer
	2. Inside vasp.6.x.x_sol directory: run: patch -p1 < vasp.6.x.x_vtst_patch 
	3. Modify the makefile.include: Add extra "CPP_OPTIONS += -Dsol_compat" in the CPP_OPTIONS section as last line (see the modified .include file)
	4. Do 3, 4, and 5th steps of A
	5. Run a test calculation
