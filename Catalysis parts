1. Solvent Effect: We do in gas phase and in small system size (not the actual experimental system size) and we PREDICT the trends happening in a particualr reaction.

2. If all the intermediates are of similer types (e.g. *O,*OOH,*OH) will affect by solvent like water similarly, Therefore the solvent effect will be canceled out.

3. It is the polarity which affect mostly when considering the solvent effect, some cases H-bond and other
