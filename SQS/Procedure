Here's how to exactly create the disordered structure using SQS
1. For Divisible concentration
    write it for later




2. For Fractional concentration (eg. Te=0.6666,Se=0.3334) [one suggesion Increase the decimal points]
a) Create the input file rndstr.in (eg.  /home/mrcuser/soumen/prev/coll/Deparment/Ravi-Sir/disor/Bi2Te2Se/2x2_try)
b) run the command corrdump -l=rndstr.in -ro -noe -nop -clus -2=7 (Find out meaning of all terms)
-l=rndstr.in: This specifies the input file (rndstr.in) that contains the random structure information. The -l option is used to load this file.

-ro: This option stands for "read-only". It indicates that the input file should be read without making any modifications to it.

-noe: This stands for "no energy". It tells the program not to calculate or consider the energy of the configurations.

-nop: This stands for "no output". It suppresses the output of certain files or information that might be generated during the process.

-clus: This option is used to specify the cluster interactions. It is typically followed by a specification of the type and size of clusters to be considered.

-2=7: This specifies that pair (2-body) interactions up to a distance of 7 units should be considered. The -2 indicates pair interactions, and =7 sets the maximum distance for these interactions.
Change the value of interaction distance if not work or use
corrdump -l=rndstr.in -ro -noe -nop -clus -2=7
-3=10 (three body interaction)

you usually get a waring --- unit cell is not primitive, and usually it get converge and two new files will be generated 
clusters.out and sym.out. 

c) Create sqscell.out file (eg. look into the path /home/mrcuser/soumen/coll/Deparment/Ravi-Sir/disor/Bi2Te2Se/2x2_try)
d) run mcsqs -rc
e) for large system forcefully stop after few time
f) Convert bestsqs.out to POSCAR.cif using the command: str2cif <bestsqs.out> POSCAR.cif
g) check the concentration is desirable or not as you wanted (say Te:Se = 2:1)

This is the local path /home/thsim2/Documents/Soumen/project/Collaboration/Department/Ravi-Sir/Bi2Te2Se/new/sqs/new/2x2/2x2_try
