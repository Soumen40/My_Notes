Put the different ERROR related to the VASP calculations

1. POSCAR found type information on POSCAR  
 ERROR: the type information is not consistent with the number of types
 solution: just rearrange the element name and corresponding coordinates

2. For vibrational frequency calculation with large system + adsorbate use LREAL = Auto, ALGO = FAST, MAXMIX = 60

3. subspace matrix is not hermitian ----- put IALGO = 48

4. For some relaxation if giving error put IBRION = 1, delete ENCUT

5.
